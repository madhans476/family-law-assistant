The relevant extracts of judgments off SC are as follows. Your advocate must be very careful while drafting all these three major grounds.  ========================================================================================= Non consummation of marriage entitles you to get divorce. Supreme Court Says, \"Spouses owe rights and duties to each other and in their relationship they must act reasonably.\"  A petition for divorce under Section 13 (1)(1-a) and (iii) of the HMA on the ground of cruelty as well mental disorder.can be filed by you.  The Court observed, “Undoubtedly, not allowing a spouse for a long time, to have sexual intercourse by his or her partner, without sufficient reason, itself amounts mental cruelty to such spouse. A Bench of Three Judges of this Court in Samar Ghosh Vs. Jaya Ghosh (2007) 4 SCC 511 has enumerated some of the illustrations of mental cruelty.”... ================================================================================== India grants divorce to man whose wife refused to live with in-laws India’s supreme court has granted a divorce to a man on the grounds of “cruelty” after his wife refused to share a home with her in-laws, effectively ruling that a married woman must live with her husband’s family. Justice Anil R Dave, one of the the most senior judges in India, said the wife’s desire to leave her in-laws’ home was inspired by “western thought” and violated traditional values of Indian Hindus. “In normal circumstances, a wife is expected to be with the family of the husband after the marriage,” stated the supreme court ruling, which also dismissed the wife’s attempt to kill herself as a plot to “torture” her husband and his relatives. There is no legal obligation for men to live with their parents, so the ruling still allows couples to live independently if men choose to set up a separate home. But the case had been seen as a test, pitting the rights of women against traditional Hindu values. Activists said the ruling left millions of women who were in unhappy marriages or with abusive husbands even more vulnerable. “If you look at the language the court has used, it’s very regressive,” said Tenzing Chusang, from the Women’s Rights Initiative, a lawyers’ collective. “If you make the grounds of divorce very lenient for men, it makes the woman very vulnerable.” Divorce in India carries a huge stigma: there are few financial provisions for divorced women, and little legal support. Chusang said: “In India there’s no such thing as shared matrimonial property or equal division of assets. All she gets if the husband divorces her, and that too after years of litigation, is a minimal maintenance payment. What can she do? She has to stay.” The judge said the wife’s claims that her husband was having an affair were fabricated, and that her suicide attempt was a devious attempt to manipulate her husband’s family.\nRelevance Score: 0.604\n\n[Source 5] (Category: family_law)\nTitle: To file the case on partner\nContent: Expert 2: Who wish to take benefit of Indian laws and legal system to avoid facing up to any foreign judicial system. Divorce allows a person to break free from an onerous marital relationship. As per the law as it stands our legal system does not allow divorce to be granted on the ground of irretrievable breakdown of marriage or irreconcilable differences. To get a divorce one has to prove wrongdoing on the part of other spouse, and impeccable conduct of one’s own in order to win. Divorce is granted only on proof of fault or guilty conduct of one party and innocence of the other. The most common ground for divorce is cruelty. Another common ground is adultery (sexual intercourse outside wedlock) one instance of lapse of virtue can lead to divorce. Adultery is a ground for divorce under Section 13(1)(i) of Hindu Marriage Act, the spouse who engages in extra-marital intercourse is guilty of adultery. In case of adultery direct proof is difficult to get and one has to rely for proof thereof on circumstantial evidence and the same may be sufficiently proved from which adultery maybe inferred. The burden of proving adultery in a matrimonial case is on the person who makes the allegation. The standard of proof in \"proceedings under the Act being initially of a civil nature is by preponderance of, probabilities and not by proving it beyond reasonable doubt. General evidence of the ill-repute of the husband or of the lewd company that he keeps, or even that he knows the addresses of prostitutes and was seen with doubtful women, would neither prove nor probabilise adultery. Adulter , as a general rule, is proved by presumptive proof based on: (i) circumstantial evidence,  (ii) evidence 0 non-access and the birth of children,  (iii) Contracting venereal disease,  (iv) evidence of visit to houses of ill-repute,  (v) admissions made In previous proceedings,  (vi) confessions and admissions of the parties Mere suspicion is not sufficient.  Section 19 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 (HMA). It deals with territorial jurisdiction of Petitions filed under the Act.Every petition under this Act shall be presented to the district Court within the local limits of whose ordinary original civil jurisdiction – (i) the marriage was solemnized, or (ii) the respondent, at the time of the presentation of the petition, resides, or (iii) the parties to the marriage last resided together, or (iii-a) in case the wife is the petitioner, where she is residing on the date of presentation of the petition, or (iv) the petitioner is residing at the time of the presentation of the petition, in a case where the respondent is, at that time, residing outside the territories to which this Act extends, or has not been heard of as being alive for a period of seven years or more by those persons who would naturally have heard of him if he were alive.\nRelevance Score: 0.601\n\n\nUSER QUESTION: What are grounds for divorce?\n\nProvide a comprehensive, helpful response based on the above context."
